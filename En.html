    <div id="dibg2">The history of the Bulgarian lands can be divided into 5 main periods: 
        Prehistory, Antiquity, Middle Ages, Ottoman rule and Contemporary History.
         Due to its geographical location, the territory of today's Bulgaria is among the earliest populated areas in Europe. 
         In the 3rd millennium BC. it is occupied by the Thracians, an Indo-European people believed to have come to 
         the Balkans from the northeast. They created their own states, which flourished during Hellenism.
          In the middle of the 1st century BC. the Thracians were subjugated by Ancient Rome.
             <p><img class="vlad" src="img/asparuh.jpg"/>After the disintegration of Greater Bulgaria,
                 which was conquered by the Khazars, part of the Proto-Bulgarians, led by Asparuh, 
                 and another, led by Kuber, moved to the Balkan Peninsula and merged with the Slavs,
                  who came from the north in the early VI century and mixed with the local Byzantines.
                   After Asparuh won a victory over the army of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV,
                    an agreement was reached between Asparuh and Constantine. According to him,
                     the proto-Bulgarians and the Slavs received most of the territory between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube.
                      This marks the beginning of the creation of the emerging Bulgarian nation. 
                      The treaty with Byzantium from 681 is accepted as the moment of creation of the First Bulgarian state.</p>
                    <p><img class="vlad" src="img/krum.jpg"/>During the reign of Krum (803 - 814) Bulgaria grew to the southwest and southeast,
                         inhabiting the area of today's Sofia in 811 and today's Edirne in 813.
                          He defeated Emperor Nicephorus I in the battle of the Varbishki Pass on July 26, 811.
                           and from his skull he makes a forged cup. He reached the gates of Constantinople,
                            but failed to cross them.</p> <p><img class="vlad" src="img/boris.jpg"/>Knyaz Boris I (Michael) (852 - 889)
                            accepted Christianity as the official religion. The resistance in the face of some boyars was brutally crushed
                            - those who did not want to accept the new religion were persecuted and killed.
                             He dethroned and blinded his eldest son, Prince Vladimir Rasate (889-893), for his attempt to restore paganism.
                              Knyaz Boris I undertook this move to unite proto-Bulgarians and Slavs,
                               who at that time had radically different religions, as well as to strengthen the international prestige of
                                Bulgaria in the strong "family" of Christian states. Bulgarians received the right to their own 
                                archbishopric church. Around 886, Boris received in Bulgaria the disciples of Cyril and Methodius 
                                expelled from Great Moravia - Clement, Nahum and Angelarius. Thus the alphabet created by
                                 the brothers Cyril and Methodius - the Glagolitic alphabet.</p><img class="vlad" src="img/simeon.jpg"/>
                                 The time of Simeon I is called the Golden Age. He received his education in Constantinople and built many
                                  literary centers throughout Bulgaria. Simeon I became a serious threat to the Byzantine Empire.
                                   After many military successes, he set out to conquer Constantinople. He proclaims himself emperor. 
                                   With it, Bulgaria reaches three seas. </div>

        Oil roses are plants of the genus Rose, known for their essential oil, which is used in perfumery and cosmetics.
         They are also known as "Otto rose" - roses with rose oil. It is believed that the cultivation of roses to produce rose water
          and later rose oil began in India and Egypt. With the movement of Turks and Arabs in the 9th century, it was transferred to
           Persia and Tunisia. The trade in rose oil in Europe began in the 16th century, and the first data on rose plantations in our
            lands are from the 17th century - around Edirne, and within today's Bulgaria the first documentary information is from 1712 
            about the land of the village of Voinyagovo, Karlovsko. It is known for sure that in the middle of the 19th century the so-called
             Rose Valley was formed in the area between Kazanlak, Karlovo and Strelcha. Before the Liberation in Bulgaria there were about
              10 thousand decares of plantations and the production of rose oil reached 1000 kg. The largest areas were created and cultivated
               around the First World War - about 90 thousand acres, after which the area decreased to 30 thousand acres.
